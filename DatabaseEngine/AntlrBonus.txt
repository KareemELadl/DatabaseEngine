for the antlr bonus we made a selectStatement in antlr then in the DBApp class we implemented the parseSQL method that takes a stringBuffer
it generates a parse tree according to the selectStatement we have in the grammar and from this parsetree we get the table name , column names , operators
we create array of sqlTerms according to the columns, values , table name , operations and we generate array of operators 
and then pass these 2 arrays to the method selectFromTable we implemented in this milestone
